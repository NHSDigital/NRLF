- Authoriser parses headers for authorization into the "request context" to be used by API lambdas
- S3 bucket implemented for authorization lookup where nrl.enable-authorisation-lookup has been set
- All API lambdas read the authorisation from the event "request context" instead of the event headers
- (in nrl-producer-api repo) Update producer apigee proxy to optionally use enable-authorisation-lookup instead of nrl-ods-XXX

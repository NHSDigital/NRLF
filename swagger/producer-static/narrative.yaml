    ## Overview

    The National Record Locator (NRL) enables organisations to share Patient data nationwide.  It acts as an Index, or Directory, of patient data.  Rather than handling the data itself it shares pointers held in partner systems, using the FHIR R4 DocumentReference standard.

    Users of the service fall into the categories of:

    * Producers - capable of creating and managing pointers
    * Consumers - capable of searching and reading pointers

    The service removes the need for organisations to create duplicate copies of information across systems and organisations, by enabling access to up-to-date information directly from the source.

    It can be used to store and publish pointers to patient data held in health systems across England and to look up where relevant patient data is held.

    There is a growing list of health and social care organisations authorised to share records using NRL.

    ### As a Producer

    * Create pointers, restricted to document types agreed during the on-boarding process
    * Replace your pointers with a newer versions, superseding the old one
    * Update the metadata associated with your pointers
    * Delete pointers
    * Search all pointers you created
    * Read any pointer you created

    ### What has changed?

    This service is a replacement for the existing [National Record Locator (NRL)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-record-locator).

    * Upgraded from FHIR STU3 to R4.
    * Improved performance and scalability.
    * Improved on-boarding experience.
    * Authenticated using [signed JWT](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-signed-jwt-authentication) rather than mTLS
    * Greater flexibility, by wider support of the FHIR R4 DocumentReference resource.

    ### Data availability, timing and quality

    Pointers are available to be consumed almost immediately after they have been produced by the provider.

    Pointers are immediately available to authorised providers and consumers after successful creation.

    ## Who can use this API

    This API:
    - is only for use by patient-facing applications
    - is only for non-clinical use
    - can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so

    You can not currently use this API to retrieve pointers for:
    - mental health crisis plans
    - end of life plans
    - emergency care plans (eRedbags)
    - national early warning scores (NEWS)
    - urgent care plan

    Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your development.
    To do this, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).

    You must do this before you can go live (see ‘Onboarding’ below).

    ## API status and roadmap

    This API is [in development](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses).

    To see our roadmap, or to suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our [interactive product backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/?tag=national-record-locator-api).

    If you have any other queries, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).

    ## Service level

    This API is a bronze service, meaning it is operational and supported only during business hours (8am to 6pm), Monday to Friday excluding bank holidays.

    For more details, see [service levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).

    ## Technology

    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#basic-rest).

    It conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange, specifically to [FHIR R4 (v4.0.1)](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/), except that it does not support the [capabilities](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#capabilities) interaction.

    It includes some country-specific FHIR extensions, which conform to [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core), specifically [fhir.r4.ukcore.stu1 0.5.1](https://simplifier.net/packages/fhir.r4.ukcore.stu1/0.5.1).

    You do not need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules.

    In particular:

    * resource names are capitalised and singular, and use US spellings, for example `/Immunization` not `/immunisations`
    * array names are singular, for example `entry` not `entries` for address lines
    * data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object

    There are [libraries and SDKs available](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir-libraries-and-sdks) to help with FHIR API integration.

    ## Network access

    This API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).

    For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).

    ## Security and authorisation

    This API uses the following access modes:

    * [Application-restricted RESTful API - signed JWT authentication](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-signed-jwt-authentication)

    ## Environments and testing

    ### Sandbox testing

    Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):
    * is for early developer testing
    * only covers a limited set of scenarios
    * is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation

    For details of sandbox test scenarios, or to try out the sandbox using our 'Try this API' feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.

    Alternatively, you can try out the sandbox using our Postman collection:

    [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/TBC)

    ### Integration testing

    Our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):
    * is for formal integration testing
    * includes authorisation

    It also includes ready-to-use TBC test data

    For more details see [integration testing with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).

    ## Onboarding

    You need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding. The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it’s worth planning well ahead.

    This API uses our online digital onboarding process.

    As part of this process, you need to demonstrate that you can manage risks and that your software conforms technically with the requirements for this API.

    Information on this page might impact the design of your software. For details, see [Onboarding support information](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/national-record-locator-producer-api/onboarding-support-information).

    To get started, see [digital onboarding](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/digital-onboarding#using-the-digital-onboarding-portal).

        Create new Pointers, or Supersede existing ones.

        * `id` is a composite of the ODS Code and an identifier that is locally unique to your system.  NRL does not generate globally unique ids, instead relies on producers to provide a locally unique id prefixed with their ODS code, making it globally unique.
        * `subject` MUST be a `Patient` reference.
        * `custodian` MUST be an `Organization` reference, and must match the `NHSD-End-User-Organisation-ODS`
        * `type` MUST match one of the Document Types agreed during on-boarding.
        * `content` MUST have at least one entry.
        * `content[].format[]` SHOULD indicate the mechanism for accessing documents, e.g.
          * `{ "code": "ssp", "display": "Spine Secure Proxy" }`
          * Further standards to be agreed.

        To supersede existing pointers you must specify:
        * at least one existing pointer in the `relatesTo` with a `target` or `replaces`.
        * The following fields MUST match the pointers being superseded:
          * `subject`
          * `type`

        This will cause a new pointer to be created and superseded pointers to be deleted.  Multiple documents can
        be superseded.

        Search Producer records, but implemented as a POST operation
        because of limitations associated with GET:

        * query string parameters are visible on the network and in logs, and may have privacy implications for consumers.
        * GET operations can be cached by intermediary network infrastructure, such as CDNs, routers and proxies.
        * URLs have a maximum length of 2,048 characters which complex searches can exceed.  NRL does not currently exceed this limit, but may evolve in the future.

    ## Overview

    The National Record Locator (NRL) enables organisations to share patient data nationwide.  Rather than storing the
    data itself, it is used to share pointers to the data, held in provider systems.  It acts as an index and not a data
    repository.  Each document pointer is defined using the
    [FHIR R4 DocumentReference](http://hl7.org/fhir/documentreference.html) standard.

    ![National Record Locator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NHSDigital/nrl-consumer-api/master/specification/nrl.png)

    Users of the service fall into the categories of:

    * producers - capable of creating and managing pointers
    * consumers - capable of searching and reading pointers

    The service removes the need for organisations to create duplicate copies of information across systems and
    organisations, by enabling access to up-to-date information directly from the source.

    It can be used to store and publish pointers to patient data held in health systems across England and to look up
    where relevant patient data is held.

    There is a growing list of health and social care organisations authorised to share records using NRL, and presently
    the pointers are classified into the following types:

    * [Mental Health Crisis Plan](http://snomed.info/sct/736253002)
    * [Emergency Healthcare Plan](http://snomed.info/sct/887701000000100)
    * [End of Life Care Coordination Summary](http://snomed.info/sct|861421000000109)
    * [National Early Warning Code 2](http://snomed.info/sct|1363501000000100)

    You can also retrieve booking and referal pointers however you can not currently do this by directly integrating with
    the National Record Locator, you must instead onboard to the [Booking and Referral - FHIR API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/booking-and-referral-fhir)

    ### As a Consumer

    Consumers can use this API to:

    * search for pointers, restricted to a single Patient at a time
    * read a specific pointer
    * operations are restricted to document types agreed during the [onboarding](#api-description__onboarding) process

    ### What has changed?

    This service is a replacement for the existing
    [National Record Locator (NRL)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-record-locator), and has the following
    changes:

    * upgraded from FHIR STU3 to R4.
    * improved performance and scalability.
    * improved onboarding experience.
    * authenticated using [signed JWT](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-signed-jwt-authentication) rather than mTLS.
    * greater flexibility, by wider support of the [FHIR R4 DocumentReference](http://hl7.org/fhir/documentreference.html) resource.

    ### Data availability, timing and quality

    Pointers are available to be consumed almost immediately after they have been produced by the provider.

    ## Who can use this API

    This API can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so. Make sure you have a valid use case before you go
    too far with your development. You must demonstrate you have a valid use case as part of digital onboarding.

    You must have the capability to verify NHS numbers by one of the following mechanisms:

      * full PDS Spine compliant system
      * Spine Mini Service PDS (SMSP)

    Connecting parties must have an appointed Clinical Safety Officer and undertake a Clinical Safety Assessment.

    You can not use this API to retrieve documents, however you should be prepared to retrieve in PDF or Unstructured
    formats.

    In order to retrieve a document, consumers must be able to interact with the National Record Locator and the Spine
    Secure Proxy (SSP).

    You can only use this API if your consuming application is only accessible using a valid NHS Smartcard for all users
    or a system that uses an authentication method supported by
    [NHS Care NHS Care Identity Service 2 (NHS CIS2)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/identity-and-access-management/nhs-care-identity-service-2).

    You must do this before you can go live (see ‘[Onboarding](#api-description__onboarding)’ below).

    ## API status and roadmap

    This API is [in development](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses).

    To see our roadmap, or to suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our
    [interactive product backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/?tag=national-record-locator-api).

    If you have any other queries, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).

    ## Service level

    This API is a bronze service, meaning it is operational and supported only during business hours (8am to 6pm),
    Monday to Friday, excluding bank holidays.

    For more details, see [service levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).

    ## Technology

    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#basic-rest).

    It conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#fhir)
    global standard for health care data exchange, specifically to [FHIR R4 (v4.0.1)](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/), except
    that it does not support the [capabilities](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#capabilities) interaction.

    It includes some country-specific FHIR extensions, which conform to
    [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core), specifically
    [fhir.r4.ukcore.stu1 0.5.1](https://simplifier.net/packages/fhir.r4.ukcore.stu1/0.5.1).

    You do not need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules.

    In particular:

    * resource names are capitalised and singular, and use US spellings, for example `Organization` not `organisations`
    * array names are singular, for example `entry` not `entries` for address lines
    * data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object

    There are [libraries and SDKs available](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir-libraries-and-sdks) to help with FHIR API integration.

    ## Onboarding

    You need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding. The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it’s worth planning well ahead.

    As part of this process, you need to demonstrate that you can manage risks and that your software conforms technically with the requirements for this API.

    Information on this page might impact the design of your software. For details, see [Onboarding support information](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/national-record-locator-consumer-fhir/onboarding-support-information).

    To understand how our online digital onboarding process works, see [digital onboarding](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/digital-onboarding#using-the-digital-onboarding-portal).

    ## Errors

    We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:

    * 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action
    * 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application
    * 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server

    Errors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our [reference guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes) for more on errors.

      summary: Retrieve patient's document pointers (POST)
      description: |
        Retrieve the document pointers for a single patient.  Your request is constrained by the document pointer types
        agreed during onboarding.  The results can also be filtered to return documents by a given `type` and/or created
        by a given `custodian`.

        This operation is also available as a http GET for convenience (see above), but POST is preferred for the
        following reasons.

        * query string parameters are visible on the network and in logs, and may have privacy implications for consumers.
        * GET operations can be cached by intermediary network infrastructure, such as CDNs, routers and proxies.
        * URLs have a maximum length of 2,048 characters which complex searches can exceed.  NRL does not currently
        exceed this limit, but may evolve in the future.

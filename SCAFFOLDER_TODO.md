- Don't create aws-accounts.json
- Maybe: Nest infrastructure under terraform/infrastructure (or ask for a location)
- Add .yo-rc.json
- No prefix on terraform state files
- No mechanism to read aws account info into terraform from aws config
- Add tags to provider
- Add special "third party" layer
- no need to have version v2 from the start in the lambdas
